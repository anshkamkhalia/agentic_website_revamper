It mentions various image fitting types (e.g., `SCALE_TO_FILL`, `SCALE_TO_FIT`, `STRETCH`) and file types (`JPG`, `PNG`, `WEBP`, `AVIF`).
*   **Custom Element Definitions**: There are custom element definitions (using `customElements.define`), suggesting the use of web components in the website's architecture.
*   **Layout Management**: Some code seems related to multi-column layout management and responsive design.
*   **Resizing and Mutation Observers**: Utilized for dynamically adjusting layouts based on content changes and window resizing.

*   **Belle D:** "I cannot rave enough about Ken, he was absolutely wonderful! This was my first home inspection and he took so much time to walk me through everything, pointing out issues in a way that 1) made me think he was extremely knowledgeable about his craft and 2) made me understand his findings. His report was INCREDIBLY detailed and thorough. I brought my dad along to the inspection and we stayed with Ken for hours and he was kind, professional, and funny and was genuinely willing to take the time to take us along on each part of the inspection. He deserves way more than 5 stars and you should 100% hire him for your next inspection!!"

        *   Attributes: `data-video-info` (JSON containing video data).
    *	**`multi-column-layouter`**: Manages the multi column layout.

4.  **Responsive Design**

    *   **`ResizeObserver`:**  Uses `ResizeObserver` to detect changes in element size and trigger re-layout calculations.
    *   **Device Pixel Ratio:**  Considers device pixel ratio for sharp image rendering on high-DPI screens.
    *   **Media Queries:**  Uses media queries (within the `srcset` generation) to serve different image sizes based on screen width.

5.  **Experiments**

    *   The code checks for experiment flags (e.g., `"specs.thunderbolt.tb_stop_client_images"`) to conditionally enable or disable certain features. This is used for A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts.

6.  **Lazy Loading**

    *   **Intersection Observer:** Uses `IntersectionObserver` to detect when an image is in the viewport and should be loaded.

7.  **Video Handling**

    *   **Video Formats:** Mentions "mp4" as a supported video format.
    *   **Video Qualities:** Handles different video quality levels.

8.  **Data Structures**

    *   The code frequently uses JSON to pass image and video data between components.
    *   It uses Maps and Sets for efficient data storage and retrieval.

**Summary**

This code is a complex system for managing and delivering images and videos within the Wix platform. It handles various optimization techniques, responsive design, lazy loading, and A/B testing. The custom elements provide a structured way to embed and manage media assets within Wix websites.

**Important Considerations for Website Generation**

*   **Wix-Specific Code:** This code is heavily tied to the Wix environment.  It relies on Wix's CDN, data structures, and custom elements.  A direct port to another platform would require significant adaptation.
*   **Configuration:** The behavior of the image and video handling is likely driven by configuration data stored elsewhere within the Wix platform.
*   **Dependencies:** The code has dependencies on other modules (e.g., `22538` for fitting types, `30012` for custom element utilities).
*   **Experiment Flags:** The experiment flags would need to be managed in a new environment to replicate the desired behavior.
*   **Backend:** The image URL generation likely relies on a backend service to perform the actual image transformations.

*   **Image Elements:** WPhtf
*   **"comp-ma4cgcta" and "comp-ma4dhb5h":** These elements could be call-to-action buttons, forms, or other interactive components.

**Key Information & Potential Next Steps**

*   **Content Extraction:** To fully populate the new website, extract the actual text content from elements such as "WRchTxtf", "WRchTxtm", and "SITE\_STRUCTURE\_WRichText\_1". The images associated with "WPhtc", "comp-ici6m42v", and "comp-ici6m437" need to be located and included.
*   **Menu Items:** Get the dropdown menu items from "DrpDwnMn0"
*   **Call to Action:** Figure out the intention of "comp-ma4cgcta" and "comp-ma4dhb5h"
*   **Brand Consistency:** Use color palette (color\_0 through color\_65) and font styles (font\_0 through font\_10) to make a consistent brand identity.
*   **Responsiveness:** The code contains responsive design elements, and it uses variables for font sizes and spacing to create a responsive layout.
*   **Overall structure**: Extract ALL of the specific content, as well as the width and height for images, logos, etc, because that would be needed.
*   **Favicons:** The website uses some favicons that should be extracted too.

Okay, I have analyzed the provided HTML and CSS code. Here's a summary of the content I could extract, focusing on business-relevant information:

**Overall Inspection Services**

This appears to be the name of the company, based on the URL: `www.overallinspectionservices.com`.

**Website Functionality and Structure:**

*   The code uses Wix as its website builder, indicated by meta tags and script sources.
*   The website is designed to be responsive.
*   The site utilizes various scripts for performance optimization, security, and feature management (e.g., `handleAccessTokens.inline.698ac2a0.bundle.min.js`, `overrideGlobals.inline.ec13bfcf.bundle.min.js`).
*   The code manages user sessions.
*   The code includes experiments for hardening fetch and XHR requests for security.
*   The site uses a mesh layout for structuring the content on the page.
*   The site includes features for service worker registration (though registration is disabled).

**CSS Styling & Presets**

*   The CSS suggests a use of color theming with primary, secondary, accent, and custom color variables (`--color_11`, `--color_15`, etc.)
*   It appears to use presets for buttons (`wst-button-*`) and fonts (`wst-font-style-*`).

**Important Considerations for Redesign:**

*   **Keep the content intact:** The instructions state this explicitly.
*   **Maintain brand identity:** This means retaining the company name ("Overall Inspection Services"), and any logos/branding that are on the actual website (which aren't visible in this code).  The color theming from the CSS (`--color_*` variables) should also be considered to maintain a consistent brand look.
*   **Ensure mobile-first responsiveness:** The original code appears to have responsiveness built in, so this needs to be maintained and enhanced.
*   **Focus on UI/UX:** Improve the user interface and overall user experience.
*   **Specific Technologies:** The site utilizes React components.

**In Summary:**

The provided code represents a Wix-built website for "Overall Inspection Services." It includes responsive design elements, security measures, and uses a mesh layout. The CSS indicates a theming system with color and font presets. The redesign should prioritize a modern aesthetic while preserving content, brand identity, and mobile-first responsiveness.


Okay, I will extract all meaningful business content from the provided HTML code. Here's a summary of the information I could gather:

**Business Information Summary:**

Unfortunately, the provided HTML primarily contains CSS code related to layout and styling. There is no readily apparent business information, company description, contact details, address, or any other business-related content directly embedded within the visible code snippets.

**Here is a breakdown of what the code seems to represent:**

*   **Styling and Layout:** The majority of the code consists of CSS styles defining the visual appearance of various elements (buttons, images, text, sections, menus, etc.). These styles control things like colors, fonts, spacing, borders, shadows, and responsiveness.
*   **Image Handling:** Some CSS classes (e.g., `.BI8PVQ`, `.bHLGFC`, `jhxvbR`) relate to image display, including filters, masking, and handling of image loading.
*   **Responsiveness:** Media queries (`:host(.device-mobile-optimized)`, `body.device-mobile-optimized`) indicate an attempt to make the website adapt to different screen sizes (mobile devices).
*   **Animations/Transitions:** Classes like `.hLoBV3`, `.ftlZWo`, `_6zG5H`, etc., suggest the presence of animations or transitions when elements are interacted with (e.g., hover effects, menu appearances).
*   **Menu System:**  CSS related to `.eK3b7p`, `.ULfND1`, and `.HYblus` points to the styling of a dropdown menu system.
*   **Section Styling:** CSS like `.MW5IWV` and `.dkukWC` seems related to styling different sections of the website.

**Essentially, the code provides the visual structure and interactive behaviors of a website but lacks specific content about the business itself.**

If you provide the actual HTML containing text, images with alt text, or any other content elements, I can extract that and give you a complete summary.

**General Website Information:**

*   **Fonts:** arial-w01-black (various unicode ranges), arial, 'ｍｓ ｐゴシック', 'ms pgothic', '돋움', dotum, helvetica, sans-serif
*   **Colors:** A wide range of colors are defined using RGB values (e.g., color\_0: 255,255,255 which is white). Key colors appear to be:
    *   White (color\_0, color\_1, color\_8, color\_11, color\_36, color\_50, color\_51, color\_56, color\_57, color\_62, color\_63)
    *   Black (color\_2, color\_15, color\_37)

    *   Yellow (color\_31, color\_32, color\_33, color\_34, color\_35, color\_42)

**Navigation/Menu:**

*   There's code relating to menu styling (e.g., `.eK3b7p`, `.HYblus`).  It seems to support dropdown menus (`.QQFha4`, `.vZwEg5`), different menu alignments, and styling for hover/selected states (`.ULfND1[data-state~=over]`, `.ULfND1[data-state~=selected]`).  It uses variables for background, text, and border colors, as well as border-radius.
*   Dropdown menus can be configured to drop up or down (`[data-dropmode=dropUp]`).

**Images:**

*   The code includes styling for images, including a blur effect that animates out when the image is loaded (`[data-animate-blur]`).
*   It supports masking images (`-webkit-mask-image`, `mask-image`).
*   There are variables to control image minimum height and width (`--image-min-height`, `--image-min-width`).

**Forms/Input Fields:**

*   There are styles for input fields (`.KvoMHf`, `.rEindN`), including text inputs and textareas.
*   It allows for labels on input fields (`.wPeA6j`, `.PSkPrR`).
*   There are styles for invalid input and error messages (`.LyB02C .KvoMHf:invalid`, `.wBdYEC`).
*   It handles hover, focus, and disabled states for input fields.

**Responsiveness:**

*   The code includes media queries (`:host(:not(.device-mobile-optimized)) .EwS2PT`, `body:not(.device-mobile-optimized) .EwS2PT`) suggesting a mobile-first approach.
*   It uses a `--site-width` variable, likely to control the maximum width of the content on larger screens.

**Animations/Transitions:**

*   There are CSS transitions for various elements, like menus and background colors.
*   Keyframe animations are defined for a loading spinner (`@keyframes kYZz2Z`, `@keyframes wlf4P4`).

**Accessibility:**

*   Focus styles are managed for accessibility (`#SITE_CONTAINER.focus-ring-active`), with a specific highlight color (`#116dff`).
*   The code uses `clip-path` to initially hide a focus ring, making it appear only on focus or active states (`._pfxlW`).

**Dividers:**
*   There appears to be code to deal with dividers on the page with a divider height and offset.

# Overall Inspection Services Contact Information:

This HTML code represents the "Contact" page for Overall Inspection Services. It includes the following key elements:

*   **Company Information:** The business is called "Overall Inspection Services".
*   **Contact Form:** A contact form with fields for "Name," "Email," "Subject," and "Message," allowing users to send inquiries directly.
*   **Additional Information:** There is space for additional contact details or an image, with a placeholder image included.

This detailed summary captures all the meaningful business content available on the page.


Okay, here's a summary of the content that can be extracted from the provided code:

**General Business Information**

Based on the code, it appears this is a website for a business. However, specific details about the business (name, industry, services, etc.) are *not* explicitly present in the code snippets provided. The site is built on the Wix platform (IDs and URLs related to "wix-thunderbolt" and "parastorage.com" are present).

**Key Observations & Potential Areas for Content**

1.  **Site Structure:** The code indicates a standard website structure with a header, content area (`PAGES_CONTAINER`), and footer.

2.  **Mobile Optimization:** There are many instances referring to mobile optimization, implying the website is designed to be responsive.

3.  **Styling and Presets:**  The presence of "wix-presets-wrapper" and CSS variables like `--wst-button-color-fill-primary` suggest that there is a visual style applied to the page. It would be useful to inspect the values of the color variables for brand color information.

4.  **Image Handling:** There are code snippets concerning the loading and display of images (`.jhxvbR img`, `.BI8PVQ img`). Also present are mentions of possible "blur" animations.

5.  **Buttons**: Elements of buttons that might be customizable, such as "StylableButton2545352419" with root, link, label and icon classes.

**Missing Information**

Crucially absent are the following:

*   **Business Name:** No explicit name is found.
*   **Contact Information:** No phone numbers, addresses, or email addresses are in the provided snippets.
*   **About Us/Description:** No text content describing the business, its mission, or its values.
*   **Products/Services:** No details about what the business offers.
*   **Location:** No geographic information is present.

In essence, the code provides the *structure* and *styling* framework for a website, but the actual *content* is missing from the supplied sections.

Because the data is missing, it is impossible to provide a more specific summary.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the content extracted from the provided HTML and CSS:

**I. General Website Information**

*   **Title:** "Contact | oisllc"
*   **Canonical URL:** "https://www.overallinspectionservices.com/contact"
*   **OG Title:** "Contact | oisllc"
*   **OG URL:** "https://www.overallinspectionservices.com/contact"
*   **OG Site Name:** "oisllc"
*   **OG Type:** "website"
*   **Twitter Card:** "summary\_large\_image"
*   **Twitter Title:** "Contact | oisllc"

**II. CSS Theme Variables**

The CSS includes a comprehensive set of theme variables that define the color palette and font styles used throughout the site. This is crucial for maintaining brand consistency.

*   **Colors:** A wide range of colors are defined using RGB values (e.g., `--color_0:255,255,255;` for white). These colors are referenced throughout the CSS to style various elements.
*   **Fonts:** Several font styles are defined, including font family, weight, style, size, and line height (e.g., `--font_0:normal normal normal 55px/1.4em 'arial black',arial-w01-black,sans-serif;`).  The font definitions also include specific unicode ranges.

**III. Form Styles (Contact Form)**

The CSS includes styles for text input fields (`TextInput.de084f5c.min.css`) and text area input fields (`TextAreaInput.c3161127.min.css`), which suggests the presence of a form, likely a contact form on this page.  These styles control the appearance of the form elements, including:

*   Background color
*   Border color, style, and width
*   Border radius
*   Box shadow
*   Text color
*   Font
*   Padding
*   Placeholder text color
*   Hover, focus, disabled, and invalid states
*   Label styles (if labels are used)
*   Error message styles

**IV. UI Elements and Layout**

The CSS also suggests the presence of common UI elements and layout features:

*   **Header and Footer:** Styles related to `#SITE_HEADER` and `#SITE_FOOTER` indicate a standard header and footer structure.
*   **Dropdown Menu:** The inclusion of `rb_wixui.thunderbolt[DropDownMenu_SolidColorMenuButtonSkin].3c6b3073.min.css` indicates a dropdown menu is present.
*   **Images:** Styles for images (`.jhxvbR img`) define max-width and blur effects.
*   **Sections:** Styles related to `ClassicSection.6435d050.min.css` point to the use of sections to structure the page.
*   **Lines:** Styles for `VerticalLine_ClassicVerticalSolidLine.f07c5db9.min.css` suggest vertical lines used for visual separation.
*   **"Skip to Content" Button:**  Styles for a "SkipToContentButton" are included, improving accessibility.
*   **Animations:**  There are CSS animations defined (keyframes `kYZz2Z` and `wlf4P4`) likely for loading or interactive elements.

**V. Master Page Styles**

The CSS with ID `css_masterPage` seems to define overall layout and theming for the entire site.

*   It adjusts the display properties of different sections on the page.
*   The CSS also defines focus styles for keyboard navigation.
